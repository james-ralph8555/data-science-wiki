# Binning
- Technique to transform numerical data into categorical data
- e.g. continuous age data can be binned into 20-29, 30-39, etc.
- Useful when there is uncertainty in measurements as that scenario does not neccessarily lose information by binning
- Quantile binning can be used to give equal sized bins
