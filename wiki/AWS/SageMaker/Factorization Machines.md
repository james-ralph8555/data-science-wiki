  - Classification
---
- For classification or regression of sparse data with sparse data
- Works well for reccomender systems since that data is inherently sparse since users interact with only a small subset of products
- Supervised algorithm, limited to pair-wise interactions e.g. User->item
- Takes recordIO-protobuf format in Float32
- Works via finding factors to predict a classification or value given a matrix representing pairs (e.g. user->item)
- Hyperparameters:
	- Initialization methods for bias, factors, and linear terms
- Uses CPU or GPU, but CPU recomended since GPUs are ill-suited for sparse data
