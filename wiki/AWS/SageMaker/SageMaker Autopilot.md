- AutoML service
- Selects algorithm, preprocesses data, tunes model, and handles infrastructure
- Generates Jupyter notebook to show what is happening
- User selects target feature for training
- Shows leaderboard of model performance
- Data must be tabular CSV
- Works with binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression
- Works with [[Linear Learner]], [[XGBoost]], and deep-learning algorithms
- Integrates with SageMaker Clarify to show how models come to predictions
- Shows feature importance for a given prediction
- Suitable problems: classification, regression, [[Principal Component Analysis|PCA]], some missing values
- Not for autopilot: vision/text/sequence based data, mostly missing data, features need interpretation, need a pretrained models
