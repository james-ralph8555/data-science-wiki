- Identifies all objects in image, with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- Can train from scratch, use a pre-trained model, or use transfer learning from imageNet
- Input data can be RecordIO or images (jpg or png) with JSON annotation data
- Uses a CNN with the Single Shot multibox detector (SSD) algorithm
- CNN can either be VGG-16 or ResNet-50
- Does data augmentation (flip, rescale, jitter) automatically
- Hyperparameters: the usual deep learning hyperparameters
- Uses GPU for training, multi-GPU and multi-machine allowed
