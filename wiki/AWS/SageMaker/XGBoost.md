- eXtreme Gradient boosted decision trees
- Powerful and quick to run
- Performs classification and regression
- Takes CSV, libsvm, recordIO-protobuf, and parquet formats
- Many hyperparameters to tune
	- Subsample - prevents overfitting
	- Eta - step size shrinkage; prevents overfitting
	- Gamma - minimum loss reduction to partition tree; larger value prevents overfitting
	- Alpha - L1 regularization term
	- Lambda - L2 regularization term
	- eval_metric - metric to optimize on e.g. AUC, error, RMSE
	- scale_pos_weight - adjusts balance of weights; useful for unbalanced classes
	- max_depth - max depth of tree; setting too high can overfit
- Training uses CPU's only for multiple instance training
- Memory bound algorithm
- With newer XGBoost versions, single-instance GPU training is available
- **In general, training on GPU can be more cost-efficient due to faster training**
