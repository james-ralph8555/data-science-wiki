- Pixel-level object classification: each pixel is given an object label
- Output is a segmentation mask
- Input can be jpg or png with annotations, or augmented manifest image format, which enables support for pipe mode
- jpg accepted for Inference
- Uses MXNet Gluon and Gluon CV with supports for 3 algorithms:
	- Fully-Convolutional network (FCN)
	- Pyramid scene parsing (PSP)
	- DeepLabV3
- Two backbones are supported: ResNet50 and ResNet101, both optionally pre-trained on imageNet for transfer learning
- Hyperparameters are the usual, but algorithm and backbone can be chosen
- Only GPU on a single machine supported for training
