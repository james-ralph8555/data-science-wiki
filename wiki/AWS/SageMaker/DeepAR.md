- For forecasting 1D time series data
- Can take multiple related [[Time Series]] as input
- Detects frequencies and seasonality
- Takes JSON lines or Parquet format
- Input can contain dynamic features such as events or categorical features
- The entire dataset should be used as the test set, and the most recent values should be withheld from the training data
- Hyperparameters
	- Context_length - how many time points the model sees before making predictions
	- Epochs
	- mini_batch_size
	- learning_rate
	- num_cells
- Can train on CPU or GPU, with single or multi machine
- Trains well on CPU for smaller models
- Inference is CPU-only
