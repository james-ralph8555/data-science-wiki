- Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm
- Detects changes in complexity of a random forest with each datapoint: larger changes in complexity mean a datapoint is more anomalous
- Input format can be RecordIO-protobuf or CSV, in file or pipe mode
- Can work on streaming data via Kinesis analytics
- Hyperparameters:
	- Num_trees - increasing this reduces noise
	- Num_samples_per_tree - should be chosen such that 1/Num_samples_per_tree equals the ratio of anomalous to normal data
- CPU only
