- Linear regression model that trains like a ML model
- Handles regression and binary/multi-class classification
- Takes in RecordIO-wrapped protobuf with float32 data or CSV data
- **First column assumed to be the label column when using CSV**
- S3 file and pipe (streaming) mode both supported
- Training data must be normalized and shuffled
- Uses an optimization algorithm like SGD
- Hyperparameters:
	- Balance_multiclass_weights - gives each class equal importance in loss functions
	- Learning_rate
	- mini_batch_size
	- L1 Regularization
	- L2 regularization weight decay
- Trains on single or multi-machine GPU (multiple GPUs on one machine does not help)
