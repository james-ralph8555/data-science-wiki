- Unsupervised clustering algorithm - divides data into K similar groups by some distance metric e.g. Euclidean distance
- Takes recordIO-protobuf or CSV input format, with file or pipe mode for either
- Each observation is mapped to a n-dimensional space
- Hyperparameters:
	- K - number of clusters - can use "elbow method" on a plot of total within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) as a function of K to find a good number
	- Mini_batch_size
	- Extra_center_factor - adds extra clusters while training which are reduced down to K clusters
	- Init_method - random or Kmeans++ - Kmeans++ starts clusters far apart to avoid initializing them too close together
- CPU or GPU for training, but CPU is reccomended
