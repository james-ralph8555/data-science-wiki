- Saves internal model state (gradients/tensors) at periodic intervals
- Define rules to detect unwanted conditions (e.g. exploding/vanishing gradients) in training
- Logs a cloudwatch event when unwanted conditions are encounters
- Integrates with [[SageMaker Studio]] via SageMaker Studio Debugger
- Autogenerates training reports
- Several built in rules:
	- Monitor system bottlenecks
	- Profile model framework (e.g. tensorflow) operations
	- Debug model parameters
- Supports Tensorflow, PyTorch, MXNet, XGBoost, SageMaker generic estimator
- Can create custom hooks and rules
