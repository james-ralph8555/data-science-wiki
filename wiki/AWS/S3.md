# Use Cases
- Data lake
- Back up and restore data
- Achive data at the lowest cost
# Properties
- Object Storage
- Buckets must have a globally unique name
- Max object size of 5TB
- 99.99999999999% (11 9's) object durability
- Partitions should be setup to optimize queries
	- Data that is queried predominately by date would be
		s3://bucket/dataset/year/month/day/product/data.csv
	- Data that is queried predominately by product would be
		s3://bucket/dataset/product/year/month/day/data.csv
# S3 storage classes comparison:
- Standard
	- 99.99% availability - objects may not be available 53 minutes per year
	- Good for general purpose storage e.g. big data analytics
- Infrequent Access
	- For data that requires rapid access but is less frequently accessed e.g. disaster recovery and backups
	- 99.9% availability
	- Need to wait 30 days to transition S3 standard data to IA
- One Zone Infrequent Access
	- Same as infrequent access but data is only replicated in a single availibility zone
	- 99.5% availability
	- Useful for secondary backup copies of data or data that can be recreated
	- All tiers below and including this one incur retrieval fees
- Glacier Instant Retrieval
	- For long term data storage that needs to be accessed instantly
	- Minimum storage duration of 90 days
- Glacier Flexible Retrieval
	- For long term storage where data does not need to be accessed instantly
	- Offers expedited (1-5 mins), standard (3-5 hours) and bulk (5-12 hours) access times
	- Minimum storage duration of 90 days
- Glacier Deep Archive
	- Offers standard (12 hours) and bulk (48 hours) retrieval options
	- Minimum storage duration of 180 days
- S3 Intelligent tiering to auto manage object storage class based on access patterns
- S3 lifecycle classes can be used to define rules for a bucket, a folder (prefix) in a bucket, or object tag:
- Transition rules can be setup to move objects to a certain storage class after a specified time
- Expiration rules can be setup to delete files after a specified time or delete old versions of files
# S3 Security
- S3 Encryption:
	- SSE-S3: server size encryption (S3) fully managed by AWS
	- SSE-[[Key Management Service|KMS]]: uses AWS Key Management server to manage encryption keys; allows audit trail for KMS key usage
	- SSE-C: user manages own encrypton keys
	- Client side encryption: files encrypted by user before upload
- S3 access can be configured by user with [[IAM]] policies to give certain action access by user (e.g. read or write access)
- S3 access can be set up based on resource using bucket policies to set bucket-wide policies.  With these, one can force encryption, allow cross account access, and grant public access to an entire bucket.
- S3 bucket policies are configured in JSON
- S3 resource based policies can also be configured with an Object Access Control List (ACL) to set permissions by object
